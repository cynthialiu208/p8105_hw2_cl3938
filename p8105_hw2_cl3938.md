\#Question 1

Define relative path to the data

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read in the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Combine the two precipitation datasets:

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland.Mr. Trash Wheel collects litter and
debris carried by the Jones Falls River toward the harbor, and to date
has removed over a million pounds of litter. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and volume trash collected, broken down by
major trash types (for example, plastic bottle vs polystyrene amounts,
number of chip bags).

There are a total of 344 rows in our final Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

  - An observation of interest: the median number of sports balls found
    in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

Additional information regarding precipitation is also available in this
dataset, primarily inches of precipitation broken down into year and
month for the years 2017 & 2018.

There are a total of 24 rows in our final Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

\#Question 2

Define relative path to the data

``` r
subway_data_file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
```

Read in the NY Subway Transit information.

``` r
ny_transit_df = 
    read_csv(
        file = subway_data_file) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry,'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE) )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset comprises entry and exit data for every subway station in
NYC. Variables contained include line, station name, longitude &
latitude, routes served, as well as information about entry and ADA
compliance. A CSV file was read in, variable names cleaned, then
variables of interest were selectively extracted. Finally, the entry
variable was recoded from character to logical. This data is not tidy
because the vending variable could be further cleaned into a logical,
duplicates have not been removed, and the route variables can be further
cleaned using pivot\_longer.

This data set has 1868 rows and 19 columns.

There are 465 unique stations.

There are 1868 stations that are ADA compliant

0.3770492 of station entrances without vending allow entrance

\#Question 3

Define relative path to the data

``` r
pol_data_file = "./data/pols-month.csv"
snp_data_file = "./data/snp.csv"
unemployment_data_file = "./data/unemployment.csv"
```

Read and clean pols-month

``` r
pols_df = 
    read_csv(
        file = pol_data_file) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(president = if_else(prez_gop==0, "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

SNP cleaning

``` r
snp_df = 
    read_csv(
        file = snp_data_file) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "/") %>%
  arrange(year,month) %>%
  select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )
